# 💀 Skeletal Shenanigans: A Spine-Tingling Adventure With a Side of Chaos

Welcome to the official GitHub home of **Skeletal Shenanigans** — a delightfully spooky and quirky game where skeletons aren't just background props… they're the stars of the show. Whether you’re a player looking for some bone-rattling fun or a developer curious about the code behind the chaos, this project is for you.

## 🕹️ What Is Skeletal Shenanigans?

**[Skeletal Shenanigans](https://skeletalshenanigans.io)** is a fast-paced, puzzle-platformer (with a generous dose of dark humor) set in a haunted world filled with rebellious skeletons, tricky traps, and strange magic. You play as a misfit skeleton trying to escape the cryptic depths of the Undead Realm — solving puzzles, dodging hazards, and raising a little hell along the way.

Unlike typical horror games, Skeletal Shenanigans leans into a fun, cartoonish aesthetic with slapstick-style physics and unexpected interactions. Think *Goose Game meets Hollow Knight*, but everyone's made of bones.

## 🧠 Key Features

- **Bone-Based Physics**: Limbs fly, joints detach, and bones bounce — often hilariously.
- **Hand-Crafted Levels**: Each level is full of clever puzzles, hidden secrets, and spooky surprises.
- **Spooky-Charming Aesthetic**: Tim Burton vibes meet retro pixel art.
- **Original Soundtrack**: Eerie, funky, and chaotic — just like our skeletons.
- **Modding-Friendly**: Designed to support custom levels and community content.
Want to fork the game, build your own version, or help squash bugs? You’re more than welcome to jump in. Pull requests, feedback, and memes encouraged.
